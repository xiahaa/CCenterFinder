This repository contains our implementation on accurately localizing 3D and 2D circular centers, including:

1. A 3D circular center finding algorithm based on Conformal Algebra. We also provide a RANSAC variant so that it can handle  outliers.
2. An exact 2D circular center finding algorithm that uses grid search. To solve the two-fold ambiguity problem, we give a feasible solution given two coplanar circles.
3. We show in some automation and robotics application user cases that the proposed method can help users improve the accuracy.
